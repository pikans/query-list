This is a helper program for SHITS signup order assignments. It just
queries Moira for all the current members of whatever list you give
it, and prints out the list separated by newlines.

IMPORTANT - this only works if the list is an NFS group. To make a
list an NFS group, run

blanche -nfs [the name of the list]
